## About Me

I am an undergraduate student at UC San Diego studying Mathematics - Computer Science. I am currently exploring different labs within the computer science and bioinformatics department at the Jacobs School of Engineering. My hobbies include reading, writing, dancing, feeding goats, hiking, swimming, and traveling. I also occasionally star in [music videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZgwHft8N5Q). You can find my sister's, Liz Izhikevich's, website [here](https://lizizhikevich.github.io/).
